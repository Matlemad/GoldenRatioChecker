# GoldenRatioChecker
Checks a wallet's ratio between two given assets and gives back a score

the contract checks some wallet's ratio between two given assets and its deviation from the Golden Ratio, and return a score. 
the closer the ratio to the Ratio, the closer the score to 0, and viceversa.

... just in case someone out there is interested in experimenting with esoteric DeFi.

I'm open to suggestions and improvements :namaste:
